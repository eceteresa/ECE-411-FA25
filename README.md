# ECE 411 Fall 2025 Capstone
Hi hello! Welcome to our capstone. Please review software tools used and some tutorials for how to use said tools. :D

## Tools!

Here are the basic programs you'll need to have on your computer in order to interface with the projects:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): A helpful all-in-one programming IDE. Free!
      - You can install the [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html) extension and code .ino directly into the IDE!
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/): If you would rather not use VSCode.
- Github: Not required, but _strongly_ recommended for ease of file sharing between machines. You can even work from your repo within VSCode using git bash!

### Github Onboarding Crash Course

[Using Git Graphical User Interface (GUI)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/working-on-git-for-gui/)

[Github markdown text cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

### Github Task Tracker

[Git Project Tracker Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects)
This tutorial should help you get familiar with how to use the task tracking board under "Projects" in the linked menu up above. There is a kanban template available, so it mimics what Trello can do almost exactly, if not better. The table layout was used so that it's a little easier to see who is assigned to what, and as I (Teresa) poke around with the task tracker it should be pretty intuitive to assign tasks and whatnot. And we don't have to worry about the Trello contributor limit for free accounts.
